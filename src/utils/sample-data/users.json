My days are spent organizing my sock collection by color and texture while trying to teach my pet goldfish how to juggle. I enjoy long, confusing conversations with vending machines and am currently working on a groundbreaking new dance move that involves minimal movement and maximum mystery. When I'm not attempting to communicate with squirrels, I'm perfecting my recipe for spaghetti-flavored ice cream.",
